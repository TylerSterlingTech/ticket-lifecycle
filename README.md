Jane sees that there are three tickets to be served, other than the default ticket that was sent to notify the agents and admin that the osTicket ticketing system had been installed. Jane knows that she should look into each of these three tickets and assign them to the appropriate agent. For the tickets that she assigns to herself, she will send communication to the ticket issuer, work the issue, and come to a resolution. Jane decides to begin with Karen Jone's ticket #310354, as it has emergency priority.
